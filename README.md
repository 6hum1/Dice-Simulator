# 🎲 Dice Simulator

A simple dice-rolling simulator built with Python to simulate rolling a 6-sided die. This was one of my first Python GUI projects created while exploring game development basics and learning event-driven programming.

## 📌 Features

- Simulates a 6-faced dice roll  
- Random number generation between 1 to 6  
- Graphical interface with a clickable “Roll” button  
- Shows the result of the roll visually or as text  
- Clean and beginner-friendly code

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python  
- **GUI Framework**: Tkinter (Standard Python library)  
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `random` – for generating dice roll outcomes
  - `tkinter` – for GUI interface
